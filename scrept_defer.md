### 🏷️ `<script defer>`

When you add a script like this:

```html
<script src="main.js" defer></script>
```

it changes **when and how** the browser loads and runs that JS.

---

### 🔄 What happens step by step

1. **HTML parsing starts**
   The browser begins reading your HTML file line by line.

2. **Script is found**
   When it sees `<script src="main.js" defer>`, it:

   * **Starts downloading** `main.js` *in the background* (non-blocking).
   * **Keeps parsing HTML** — it does *not* stop like a normal `<script>` would.

3. **After parsing finishes**
   Once the entire HTML document is parsed (the DOM is ready),
   the deferred scripts run **in the order they appear** in the page.

4. **Runs before `DOMContentLoaded`**
   The browser fires the `DOMContentLoaded` event **only after all deferred scripts have executed**.

### ⚙️ Timeline Comparison

| Type              | Blocks HTML parsing? | When it executes                              | Order guaranteed? |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Normal `<script>` | ✅ Yes                | Immediately when encountered                  | Yes               |
| `<script async>`  | ❌ No                 | As soon as it’s downloaded                    | ❌ No              |
| `<script defer>`  | ❌ No                 | After HTML parsing, before `DOMContentLoaded` | ✅ Yes             |

### 💡 Why use `defer`

* It **improves page load speed** by not blocking HTML parsing.
* It ensures the **DOM is ready** when your script runs.
* It’s ideal for **page initialization scripts** (e.g., DOM manipulation, event setup).

Excellent question! 👇

When I said that `main.js` “starts downloading in the background,” here’s what actually happens technically:

### ⚙️ Step-by-step: How `defer` downloads in background

1. **HTML parser encounters `<script src="main.js" defer>`**
   The browser sees the `defer` attribute and knows:

   > “I need this script later, but I don’t have to stop parsing HTML now.”

2. **The browser sends a parallel network request** [Details](https://github.com/MehediHasan-75/raw_node/blob/wip/raw-not-refactored/scrept_defer.md#L128)

   * It immediately asks the network layer (via the browser’s resource loader) to **fetch `main.js`**.
   * This happens *asynchronously* while the HTML parser continues reading the rest of the document.
   * So, two things happen **at the same time**:

     * The **HTML parser** keeps building the DOM tree.
     * The **network loader** downloads the script file.

3. **Script is stored but not executed yet**
   Once the script finishes downloading, the browser **holds it in memory** (cached in the network buffer or compiled bytecode form).

4. **Execution waits for DOM completion**
   Only **after** the DOM is fully parsed does the browser:

   * Execute deferred scripts in the order they appeared.
   * Then trigger `DOMContentLoaded`.

---

### 🧠 Analogy

Think of the browser as a multitasker:

* **Without `defer`**: it stops reading your book (HTML) every time it sees a footnote (script).
* **With `defer`**: it notes the footnote’s location, keeps reading, and later reviews all footnotes in order when done.

Would you like a small internal diagram showing this "HTML parsing + background download + deferred execution" visually?

Excellent — this is a deep and smart question! 👏
Let’s break down **why the browser uses the “network layer”** and **how it actually fetches `main.js`** when it sees a deferred script.

---

## 🌐 Why the *network layer* is involved

Browsers are built in **layers (or subsystems)** — each one with a specific job.
The **JavaScript engine** (like V8) doesn’t know how to fetch files — it only runs code.
So, when the HTML parser encounters `<script src="main.js" defer>`, it hands that task to another subsystem:

> 🧱 **The “network layer” (or “network stack”) is responsible for making HTTP/HTTPS requests and handling responses.**

This is part of the **browser kernel**, not the JS engine.
It uses the computer’s TCP/IP networking capabilities to download external resources like:

* Images (`<img>`),
* Stylesheets (`<link>`),
* Scripts (`<script>`),
* Fonts, etc.

---

## ⚙️ How the browser fetches the deferred script

Let’s go step by step:

1. **HTML parser encounters the tag**
   It adds a *fetch task* for `main.js` to the **resource loader queue**.

2. **Resource loader checks cache first**

   * If `main.js` was already downloaded before (and not expired), it uses it directly.
   * Otherwise, it proceeds to download.

3. **Network layer sends a request**

   * It opens a **TCP connection** (or uses one from the connection pool).
   * Then sends an **HTTP GET request**:

     ```
     GET /main.js HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com
     ```
   * It handles HTTPS encryption if needed (TLS handshake, certificates, etc.).

4. **Server responds**
   The server sends back something like:

   ```
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/javascript
   ```

   followed by the JS file contents.

5. **Streaming & parsing**

   * The browser starts **streaming** the response into memory.
   * Once fully received, it marks the script as *ready to execute* (but since it’s `defer`, execution is postponed).

6. **HTML parsing continues**

   * Meanwhile, the parser keeps building the DOM tree.
   * The two processes run **concurrently** (HTML parsing + network fetch).

7. **Execution phase**

   * After the DOM is fully parsed, the **main thread** executes the deferred scripts **in the order they appeared**.

---

### 🧠 Analogy

Think of the browser as a restaurant kitchen:

* The **HTML parser** is reading the recipe (building DOM).
* The **network layer** is the delivery guy fetching missing ingredients (`main.js`).
* When the parser finishes reading, all ingredients (scripts) are ready to be “cooked” (executed).
